		<text>This satchel contains various small implements that can bludgeon, cut, and pierce in ways designed to maximize pain. Meant to extract the truth, many use these tools with far more nefarious intentions. Proficiency with these tools grants the following benefits:</text>
		<text />
		<text>Exhaustion. Using these tools for 1 hour on a restrained creature causes them to gain 1 level of exhaustion, after which you must make a Dexterity (torture tools) check. The DC is equal to 20 - the creature’s Constitution modifier. On a failure, the creature takes 10 points of your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Intimidation. When you make an Intimidation check against a creature whom you used these tools against, you gain a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus + twice the level of exhaustion the creature has.</text>

		<text>This basic technology invented by the Scions sacrifices lead bullets to generate powerful azure flames that scorch the abhorrent. This device is an effort to replicate the magical ability possessed by a select few.</text>
		<text>As an action, you can cause the damascena to project blue flames in a 15-foot cone in front of you. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 11 + your proficiency bonus), taking 4d4 fire damage + a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each use of the damascena consumes 5 lead bullets.</text>

		<detail>very rare</detail>
		<text>A hand of glory is crafted from the hand of a hanged scourgeborne after it was covered in corpse wax and left to ferment in a casket.</text>
		<text>While holding the hand of glory, you can attune to one additional magical item. This magical item can only be a ring, and must be worn on the hand of glory.</text>
		<text>While holding the hand, you can use an action to set a digit of the hand ablaze and cast the invisibility spell on yourself. While a finger is ablaze, it casts bright light in a 10-foot radius that is only visible to the wearer of the hand. The spell ends early if the flame is extinguished by the wearer (no action required). In addition, while a finger is ablaze, you can cast the knock spell at will on objects within the radius of the light. The hand has 5 digits and regenerates 1 burnt digit daily at dusk.</text>

		<text>The aroma and appearance of this tea are undeniably repulsive, with seemingly still-living organisms squirming within it. However, for those who can stomach it, the tea offers impressive soothing properties.</text>
		<text>Known for temporarily alleviating the effects of madness, the darker the tea, the more potent and challenging to brew. Once ingested, the afflicted individual is relieved of the affected madness for 1 hour or until the madness ends, whichever is shorter. However, upon swallowing the tea, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC listed in the table below. On a failure, you can’t stomach the appalling taste, regurgitate the tea, and don’t gain the benefits.</text>
		<text>The tea is made in kettles that can pour up to 2d4 cups.</text>

		<name>Holy Tonic</name>
		<type>P</type>
		<magic>1</magic>
		<detail>uncommon</detail>
		<text>The mostly-clear tonic in this vial is slightly milky and sparkles when light shines through. It was originally created by a secretive branch of the Radiant Church.</text>
		<text>When you drink this tonic, you regain 4d4 + 4 hit points and are cured of all diseases you currently suffer from.</text>
		<text>	Side Effects</text>
		<text>Depending on the lore your game implements, the holy tonic can have one or more of the following side effects. These effects are hidden from player characters and no magic can reveal them.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>	&#8226; If you fall unconscious within 1d12 minutes after drinking the holy tonic, you must succeed a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or gain a long-term madness when you regain consciousness.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>	&#8226; 1 hour after you drink the holy tonic, you hear whispering voices urging you toward violence and chaos. You must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on any Persuasion checks for the next 1d4 hours. Additionally, for the duration, you are compelled to act on aggressive impulses as determined by the GM.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>	&#8226; 24 hours after you drink the holy tonic, you must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>	&#8226; 24 hours after you drink the holy tonic, you must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or crave more holy tonic. For the next 1d4 hours, you desperately search for a holy tonic and drink the first one you find. If you do not drink one within this time, you gain 1 level of exhaustion and the craving goes away.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>	&#8226; Each subsequent holy tonic you drink in a 7-day period increases the DCs for the saving throws you must make by 1. Each three holy tonics you drink in a 7-day period increases any exhaustion levels the tonic causes by 1.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>	&#8226; If you fail five Wisdom saving throws caused by a holy tonic within a 7-day period, a curse fully takes hold. You undergo a horrifying transformation into a monstrous beast, losing control of your actions and permanently becoming a beast or monstrosity of the GM's choice under their control.</text>
		<text>	GM Note: Alternatively the holy tonic can restore GM Note: Alternatively the holy tonic can restore 6d4+6 or 8d4+8 hit points.</text>

		<text />
		<text>Blaring: Firing this weapon makes a thunderous crack. The sound can be heard from up to 100 feet away. Firing a weapon with this property makes it hard to go undetected; you have disadvantage on Stealth checks to hide until the start of your next turn. In addition, if a creature is within the area of the sound blast, it has advantage on Perception checks against you.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Spread Fire: A weapon that has the spread fire property can’t make a normal attack, instead spraying a cone in front of you with a length equal to its range (for example, a blunderbuss with ‘range 20’ will fire in a 20- foot cone in front of you). Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Firearm save DC or take the weapon's normal damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Twinned Barrel: This weapon has two barrels that can each hold a bullet and can both be loaded as part of reloading the weapon. You can fire both barrels of a double barrel weapon as part of an attack, instead of each barrel individually. Doing so empties the barrel of the weapon (as per the Barrel property) but increases the damage die of the weapon on a hit (from d4 to d6 to d8 to d10 to d12).</text>

		<text />
		<text>Fan Fire: You can quickly fire this weapon by slamming the hammer repeatedly. As an action, you fire a number of bullets in a row equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 2, up to the entirety of the barrel). Each attack after the first suffers a cumulative -3 penalty to the attack roll. You cannot add any modifier to the damage roll of these attacks beyond the first (such as the bonus from your Dexterity modifier, the Sharp-shooter feat, or a magic weapon's bonus to damage rolls). When you use this action, your speed becomes 0 until the end of your turn, and attacks you make using the long range of the weapon automatically miss.</text>
		<text>If you roll a 1 on any of the attack rolls, the weapon jams and can’t be used again until it is repaired. You can use an action to make a DC 15 Sleight of Hand check, repairing the weapon on a success. Alternatively, you can spend 1 hour outside of combat to mend it, automatically succeeding on the check. If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended in a specialist’s store at a quarter of the cost of the firearm.</text>

		<detail>uncommon</detail>
		<text>Weapons: shortsword &amp; longsword, shears</text>
		<text />
		<text>The guillotine shears are a wonder of mechanical engineering, created to tend to Carmella’s garden. Once used to cut excess foliage, it has now been repurposed to sever limbs instead of greenery. This trick weapon was given to hunters as a means of containing the scourge—if they couldn’t kill the beasts, they could at least cripple them.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the guillotine is two one-handed weapons—a longsword and a shortsword. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single one-handed weapon—shears. As part of this bonus action, you can do the following:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; When transforming the swords into shears: you can make a single melee weapon attack with the shears. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative, and you can’t use the Guillotine property on this attack.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; When transforming the shears into swords: you can slide the longsword forward as part of dismounting it, making a single melee weapon attack with it. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you have the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you can ignore this limitation.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. While wielding both swords, the longsword is considered light. The shortsword deals your choice of slashing or piercing damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. The shears are a one-handed martial weapon that deals 1d10 slashing damage on a hit. In addition, it has the Guillotine property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Guillotine. Immediately after hitting a target with the shears, if you have a free hand, you can use your reaction to pull the lever, snapping the blades together and dealing an extra 1d12 slashing damage to the target. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, you deal an extra 1d12 slashing damage. If this attack deals more than one-quarter of a creature’s hit point maximum, you also chop off one the creature's limbs (anything but the head) at the GM’s discretion. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is decapitated.</text>

From the abbatoir’s meat hooks and the blunderbusses of the slain enforcers, The Slaughtered—as the manikins named themselves—crafted these versatile weapons. Nicknamed “the meat hook”, the hookshot is a trick weapon used by hunters to help close the gap to their prey in a devastating whirl of blades and gunpowder.</text>

		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the hookshot is two one-handed weapons connected by a short length of chain; a sickle and a blunderbuss. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single two-handed weapon; a blunderbuss with a bladed attachment that can act as a battleaxe.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. While untransformed, the sickle has the finesse property, and the blunderbuss doesn't have the two-handed property. Using this pair of weapons together requires the sickle to be held in one hand and the blunderbuss in the other. When you take the Attack action with the sickle, you can make an attack with the blunderbuss as a bonus action, ignoring the barrel property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. When you take the Attack action, you can attack with either the blunderbuss or the bladed attachment (which uses the stats of a battleaxe wielded with two hands). In addition, this item gains the Hookshot property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Hookshot. As an action, you can launch the sickle from the blunderbuss, to which it remains attached by a length of sturdy chain. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Dexterity modifier. If the creature is of your size or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the creature is of a size larger than yours, you are pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to it. At the end of your turn, the hook detaches from the creature and reattaches itself to the blunderbuss.</text>

		<text>Weapons: shield &amp; spear, glaive</text>
		<text />
		<text>One of the most versatile weapons of the church.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the sanctified partisan is a spear and a shield. In its transformed state, the spear is sheathed by the shield, which retracts into a massive blade; the weapon becomes a glaive.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. Using this pair of weapons together requires the spear to be held in one hand and the shield in the other. When you are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to deflect with the shield, gaining a +2 bonus to AC against that attack. If the attack misses, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack with the spear as part of the same reaction.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. This glaive doesn’t have the heavy property. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, as part of the attack, you can pierce the target, transform the weapon, and only pull out the spear. The shield remains in the target's body, impaling it. An impaled creature takes 1d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and its speed is reduced by 15 feet. To remove the shield, the impaled target can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the shield is removed and falls at the target’s feet. If you are within 5 feet of the shield, you can use a bonus action to retrieve and don it.</text>

		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, it's a stick. In its transformed state, you break it over your knee and it’s two sticks. The stick may only return to its untransformed state over the course of an hour as you use glue and bandages to bind the two pieces back together and wait for it to cure. It has the Ill Advised Weapon property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. It's a stick, has the light property, and if you hit with it, it deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. It's two sticks, each held in a hand. A hit with either stick deals 1 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage (minimum of 0).</text>
		<text />
		<text>Ill Advised Weapon. When you attack with the stick, if you roll a 1 on the d20, it is destroyed and unusable. If this occurs during the transformed state of the stick, the stick not used in the attack remains, but cannot be untransformed. If the remaining stick also is destroyed by this property, you no longer have a stick.</text>

		<text>Rather than carrying separate firearms, which often become ineffective when beasts get close, many hunters conceal them within enormous cleavers designed to rend flesh. Such creations of gunpowder and metal are aptly named rifling cleavers.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, it is is a large cleaver. In its transformed state, the weapon is a rifle. You can reload the rifle even in its untransformed state.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. After making a melee weapon attack with this weapon, you can immediately use your bonus action to make a ranged weapon attack with the rifle against a creature within range that is behind you and in a straight line with you and your first target. This shot extends the weapon, transforming it.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. Though unwieldy in melee, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the rifle. This attack uses your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals bludgeoning damage. Your weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.</text>

		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon by sliding the pommel up and down on the blade. In its untransformed state, the abyss warden's axeblade is a longsword. In its transformed state, the weapon becomes a battleaxe. As part of this bonus action, you can slam the weapon down, emitting a wave of radiance centered on you. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Both forms of the weapon deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage on a hit. This damage increases to 2d6 for the longsword against Medium or smaller aberrations and to 2d6 for the battleaxe against Large or larger aberrations.</text>

		<name>Trick Weapon: Cordyceps Sinensis</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<detail>rare</detail>
		<text>Weapons: special</text>
		<text />
		<text>To gain the benefits of the cordyceps sinensis, you must ingest it, or graft it underneath your skin. For 24 hours, the fungus will incubate within you; during that time, if you swallow liquid flames or light the grafted area ablaze, you will kill the parasite. After 24 hours have passed, the only way to remove the parasite is with a remove curse spell cast at 6th level or higher. If you receive Nawre’s Blessing, nothing short of a wish spell will remove the fungus.</text>
		<text />
		<text>While infected with the cordyceps sinensis, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</text>
		<text />
		<text>If you have Nawre’s Blessing tattooed or carved onto your body, the parasite becomes a trick weapon for you. You can use your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this magic weapon. In its untransformed state, it is a squashy tendril that emerges from your chest. In its transformed state, the parasite turns both your arms into grotesque elastic appendages of flesh.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. The tendril is a simple melee weapon for you that deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit and has the reach property. You can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the weapon. In addition, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. The tendrils infiltrate your arms, turning them into massive clobbering weapons. In this form, you cannot wield any weapon or shield in your hands. These tendrils count as simple melee weapons for you, deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit, and have the reach property. When you make an attack on your turn, you can choose to do so with both arms at once, treating them as a two-handed weapon that deals 2d8 damage on a hit.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Curse: Evolved Parasite. If you die while infected with the cordyceps sinensis, the parasite gains more control over your body; if you die three times, you become an NPC under the GM’s control, and your goals become aligned with that of Nawre. A GM can devise a way for the host to regain control over their body.</text>

		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the executioner is a scythe and a lantern. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single massive maul.</text>
		<text />
		<text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. When you hit a creature with the scythe, as part of the same attack, you can choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach to attack. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to half your initial hit. If you do so, your speed is halved until the end of your turn. In addition, the executioner has the Harvest Property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Harvest. Whenever a creature of CR 1 or higher (or 1st level or higher) dies within 15 feet of you, the lantern harvests the creature’s soul. The soul becomes trapped in the lantern and the creature cannot be resurrected until the soul is freed. As an action, you can free a soul trapped in the lantern. The lantern can hold a maximum of one soul.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. The maul gains the Soul Explosion property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Soul Explosion. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can sacrifice one of the souls held in the lantern to create a massive explosion of ghostflame, permanently destroying the soul. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage and 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.</text>

		<name>Trick Weapon: Electric Sawblade</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<detail>rare</detail>
		<text>Weapons: longsword</text>
		<text />
		<text>The electric sawblade is a viciously effective tool of war that combines the lethality of silver and electricity. The hilt and guard resemble those of a hunter's longsword, often ornately adorned with the markings of the hunter's faction, symbols of the Radiant Church, or grim skulls that embody the dominion over death of the Scions. From this hilt extends the true terror of the weapon: a broad, straight blade constructed from dozens of razor-sharp, silvered teeth arranged in a looped chain. When wielded, these teeth whirr into a blur of destructive motion, capable of rending flesh, bone, and even the thick hide of beasts with horrifying ease. A powerful generator housed within the hilt infuses the gnashing teeth with crackling energy, adding a galvanizing quality to each cut and rip.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. This longsword has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to pull the trigger under the blade to transform and infuse it with electricity for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or until you use a bonus action to stop the current. This weapon regains 1 charge for each 10 minutes that it spends inside a miniature Galespire Coil (often found inside hunter's workshops).</text>
		<text />
		<text>	This silvered longsword deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage on a hit, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls against creatures not wearing metal armor, as long as the sword has at least 1 charge.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. When a melee attack that you can see would hit you, you can use your reaction to parry the attack, adding a bonus to your AC equal to your proficiency bonus against that attack. If this causes the attack to miss you and it was made with a nonmagical weapon, the weapon is destroyed by the teeth of the sawblade.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. The surge of electricity causes the blade to rev faster, requiring both hands to control it. If you use one hand to attack with this sword while it is transformed, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with it. While transformed, the longsword deals an extra 1d6 slashing and 1d6 lightning damage. In addition, the momentum generated from it propels you. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</text>

When you are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to deflect with the shield, gaining a +4 bonus to AC against that attack. If the attack misses, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack with the spear as part of the same reaction. On a hit, as part of the attack, you can transform the weapon and a gravity barrier forms in front of you, granting you a +4 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Transformed. This glaive doesn't have the heavy property. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, as part of the attack, you can pierce the target, transform the weapon, and only pull out the spear. The shield remains in the target's body, impaling it. An impaled creature takes 2d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and its speed is reduced to 0. To remove the shield, the impaled target can use its action to make a DC 14 Strength check. Medium or smaller creatures have disadvantage on the check. On a success, the shield is removed and falls at the target's feet. If you are within 5 feet of the shield, you can use a bonus action to retrieve and don it.</text>

		<text>Untransformed. While untransformed, the sickle has the finesse property, and the blunderbuss doesn't have the two-handed property. Using this pair of weapons together requires the sickle to be held in one hand and the blunderbuss in the other. When you take the Attack action with the sickle, you can make an attack with the blunderbuss as a bonus action, ignoring the barrel property. If you hit a creature with the sickle and the blunderbuss on the same turn, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws until the end of your next turn.</text>
		<text />

		<text />
		<text>	Hookshot. As an action, you can launch the sickle from the blunderbuss, to which it remains attached by a length of sturdy chain. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Dexterity modifier. If the creature is of your size or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the creature is of a size larger than yours, you are pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to it. At the end of your turn, you can detach the hook from the creature and reattach it to the blunderbuss; if you don't, the creature is grappled by you.</text>

		<text />
		<text>	You can use this option when you make an attack with this bow. You can use this option twice, and you regain all expended uses daily at dawn. If you are a Blood Archer Fighter, you instead gain 2 additional uses of your Blood Shot feature.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the moongilded tarblood is a longbow. In its transformed state, it’s a longsword. By breaking the string, the tarblood melts and flows around the ivory handle, congealing into a longsword; if the sword handle is forcefully shoved into the blade, the weapon reverts into a longbow. Whenever you transform the weapon, the tarblood becomes unstable; your next hit with this weapon reduces the target’s speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn as the tar wraps around them, before retreating to the weapon.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. The bow can fire regular ammunition, or it can fire lead bullets, the tarblood melting them into arrows.</text>

		<text>	Explosive Retreat. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to detonate the creature. The creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The detonation pushes you 10 feet away from the creature. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</text>

At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</text>
		<text>	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Proficiency: simple, sling</text>

		<text>Weapons: whip, rapier</text>
		<text />
		<text>You have a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this weapon.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Attunement. When you attune to this weapon, the cold, lifeless snake wraps around your forearm and bites your flesh, burying its head beneath it and inflicting 1d4 piercing damage. While attuned, you cannot be disarmed of this magical weapon. Ending the attunement causes the head to retract and the item to fall to the ground.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the bladewhip is a metallic whip. In its transformed state, the weapon solidifies by coagulating your blood to form a rapier</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. Attacks you make with the serpent bladewhip add an additional 5 feet to your reach, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. In addition, if you hit a creature twice in a turn with this weapon, the whip’s devouring hunger awakens and tears out more of its flesh, dealing an extra 2d4 slashing damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. While transformed, you take 1 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns as the blade drains your blood to empower itself. This rapier gains the Fireblood Poison property and is considered silvered.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Fireblood Poison. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack using this blade, you can coat the wound with poison and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is poisoned for the next minute as its innards start to boil. This can affect creatures immune to the poisoned condition. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. This damage ignores resistance to fire damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the blade's Fireblood Poison for the next 24 hours.</text>

		<text>While attuned to this weapon, you have resistance to lightning damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, if you've taken lightning damage or spent a hit die since the start of your last turn, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the claw is a sinewy leather gauntlet, made from the muscle and hide of a galvanized prowler. In its transformed state, the claw surges with electrical energy, merging with its wearer's forearm and turning into a monstrous claw.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. The bestial hide feeds off of you in exchange for power; you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, this gauntlet devours your life force. When you hit with a melee attack, you can spend a hit die to deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>The gauntlet has 2 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you take lighting or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to instead take no damage and regain 1 hit die.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Transformed. The gauntlet merges with your form, turning your hand into an aberrant claw that you cannot be disarmed of. This claw changes the damage of your unarmed strikes to 1d8, the damage type to slashing, and you can use your Dexterity or Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls made with it.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	In addition, when you hit with a melee attack using this claw, you can spend a hit die to deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	The claw is too unwieldy to use for delicate handling, such as activating intricate mechanisms (like the trigger of a firearm) or picking locks with thieves' tools.</text>

		<name>Trick Weapon: Unstable Crumbler</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<detail>rare (requires attunement)</detail>
		<text>Weapons: cannon, maul</text>
		<text />
		<text>While holding this weapon, your attacks and spells deal double damage to structures, and fire damage you take is reduced by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the crumbler is a roaring cannon with smoke coming out of its mouth. In its transformed state, the handle extends, turning the cannon into a highly unstable and destructive maul. As part of this bonus action, you can do the following:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; When transforming the cannon into a maul, you can shoot at your feet, even if the cannon isn't loaded, using the deflagration to propel yourself and jump up to 30 feet in any direction. This jump doesn't cost you any movement.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; When transforming the maul into a cannon, you can reload the cannon and retain its unstable force. If you load it in this way, the next time you hit with an attack with the cannon attack on your turn will push you back 30 feet in a straight line.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. The unstable crumbler heats up cannonballs, transforming them into infernal ammunition. Whenever you roll a 15 or higher on the d20 when making an attack roll with this weapon, the cannonball becomes overheated and explodes on impact. When the cannonball explodes in this way, it is considered an explosive cannonball.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. Whenever you roll a 18 or higher on the d20 while making an attack roll with this weapon, the maul's head detonates, causing an effect that acts as the fireball spell (DC 15) centered on the target. If you succeed on this saving throw, you take no damage.</text>

		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon by sliding the pommel up and down on the blade. In its untransformed state, the abyss warden's axeblade is a longsword. In its transformed state, the weapon becomes a battleaxe. As part of this bonus action, you can slam the weapon down, emitting a wave of radiance centered on you. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Both forms of the weapon deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage on a hit. This damage increases to 2d6 for the longsword against Medium or smaller aberrations and to 2d6 for the battleaxe against Large or larger aberrations.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. When you hit a creature with an attack using this longsword, you can cause another creature of your choice within 5 feet of it to take radiant damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 1).</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. When you hit a creature with an attack using this battleaxe, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls made against creatures other than you until the end of its next turn.</text>

		<text>Weapons: cannon, maul</text>
		<text />
		<text>The calamitous crumbler is a weapon reserved only for the most disciplined of hunters, due to its incredible potential for destruction. Some have used it to incinerate cultist headquarters and blow gigantic aberrations to smithereens. If turned back against its creators, the effect would be catastrophic.</text>
		<text />
		<text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. While holding this weapon, your attacks and spells deal double damage to structures, and you have resistance to fire damage. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the crumbler is a roaring cannon with smoke coming out of its mouth. In its transformed state, the handle extends, turning the cannon into a highly unstable and destructive maul. As part of this bonus action, you can do the following:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; When transforming the cannon into a maul, you can shoot at your feet, even if the cannon isn’t loaded, using the deflagration to propel yourself and jump up to 30 feet in any direction. This jump doesn’t cost you any movement.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; When transforming the maul into a cannon, you can reload the cannon and retain its unstable force. If you load it in this way, the next time you hit with an attack with the cannon on your turn will push you back 30 feet in a straight line.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. The calamitous crumbler heats up cannonballs, transforming them into infernal ammunition.

When the cannonball explodes in this way, it is considered an explosive cannonball.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. Whenever you roll a 15 or higher on the d20 while making an attack roll with this weapon, the maul’s head detonates, causing an effect that acts as the fireball spell (DC 17) centered on the target.

		<name>Trick Weapon: Caldera</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<detail>very rare (requires attunement)</detail>
		<text>Weapons: battleaxe, pistol</text>
		<text />
		<text>The Caldera is an intimidating weapon. In its battleaxe form, it is crowned with a black-hole-like orb that bubbles menacingly with molten metal. This churning crucible holds the devastating axe together and serves as a searing ammunition barrel in the weapon's pistol form.</text>
		<text />
		<text>When you attune to the Caldera, the metallic crucible at its apex ignites, constantly simmering with superheated lead. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. Each time you transform the weapon, you take 1d4 fire damage as the liquid-fire reservoir that serves as a material catalyst surges with thermal energy.</text>
		<text />
		<text>In its untransformed state, the Caldera is a battleaxe that can devour its haft to reform into a pair of pistols, each holding half of the crucible. In its transformed state, the weapon is two pistols that can be slammed together to reform the crucible, alongside the rest of the battleaxe.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	When you transform this weapon into pistols, the crucible refills each of the barrels with 6 lead bullets (12 total), filling up one pistol fully, then the other. When you switch to the untransformed state of the weapon, any unfired lead bullets are re-added to the boiling metal. The boiling metal can contain up to 60 lead bullets, and the weapon can’t transform unless it contains at least 7 lead bullets. As an action, you can feed the crucible in either state by throwing lead bullets in it or by adding a cannonball, which counts as 30 bullets.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. When you hit with this battleaxe, you can expend 3 lead bullets from the boiling metal to cover the target in molten lead. The target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage, and it takes that damage again at the start of each of its turns unless it rolls on the floor (prone) or uses a bonus action to wipe off the lead.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. You pull out two fiery pistols from the molten metal. When you attack with them, you can use your Strength modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. These pistols are each loaded to full capacity, if there are enough lead bullets in the boiling metal.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	When you use the Fan Fire property of these pistols, the cumulative penalty per bullet fired is -2 instead of - 3, and the pistol deals fire damage instead of piercing damage. In addition, if you roll a 1, the gun doesn’t jam, and you instead take 1d6 fire damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Bullet Hell. As an action, if both pistols are fully loaded, you can fire both of them in rapid succession, emptying all 12 bullets. Make 6 ranged attacks with the pistols, each dealing 1d6 piercing damage and 1d6 fire damage on a hit. Each attack after the first suffers a cumulative -2 penalty to the attack roll. You cannot add any modifier to the damage roll of these attacks beyond the first—such as the bonus from your Dexterity modifier or the Sharp-Shooter feat—apart from this weapon's bonus to damage rolls. The weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.</text>

		<name>Trick Weapon: Épée Sanguine</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<detail>very rare (requires attunement)</detail>
		<text>Weapons: longsword, greatsword</text>
		<text />
		<text>This sword, formed of coagulated blood, is a dark red, nearly black color. It is warm to the touch and emits a vigorous pulse. According to legend, the blade has a will of its own and grows stronger by consuming the blood of its victims. The sword may even make its master immortal, but at a heavy cost.</text>
		<text />
		<text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a vile longsword glowing with echoes of blood. In its transformed state, the weapon is a greatsword with an even more nefarious aspect.</text>
		<text />
		<text>To transform this weapon, you must feed it blood. Each time you deal damage with this weapon to a creature that possesses blood, the épée gains 1 charge. The épée can hold up to 4 charges. Each charge lasts for 1 minute or until it is consumed. If this weapon has 1 or more charges, you can use your bonus action to transform it.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. You gain a 1d4 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that have more than half their hit points.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. You gain a 1d4 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that are bloodied (half of its hit points or fewer). In this form, the épée sanguine consumes 1 charge at the end of each of your turns, unless you’ve expended 1 or more charges that turn. It reverts back to its untransformed state if it loses all charges.</text>
		<text />
		<text>When you hit a creature with an attack using the épée, you can expend 1 or more charges to unleash the blood accumulated in the blade:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; 1 Charge. You heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; 2 Charges. You deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage and heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; 3 Charges. The target becomes bound in blood and must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 necrotic damage and is restrained until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t restrained.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; 4 Charges. Blood covers the creature’s face and chokes it. The creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned.</text>

		<text>While attuned to this weapon, you gain the following benefits:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; You are proficient with greatswords and shortswords.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage on a hit. When you hit an aberration or undead with it, the extra radiant damage increases to 2d4.</text>
		<text />
		<text>The weapon's blade emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can summon or extinguish the light at will (no action required). This weapon has the Deflective Light property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Deflective Light. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to cause a burst of sunlight to flare before the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll and transforming the weapon. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this property. This property can be used three times, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a metallic greatsword glowing with light. In its transformed state, the weapon is two shortswords emitting the same glow.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. While wielding this greatsword, your reflexes are enhanced. You gain a +1 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. When you engage in two-weapon fighting with these shortswords, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. In addition, this weapon gains the Brightburn property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Brightburn. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature two times with these shortswords, the accumulated solar energy singes them. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

		<detail>very rare</detail>
		<text>Weapons: flintlock, rifle</text>
		<text />
		<text>This weapon, crafted with moongold, gives you a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against nonhumanoid creatures. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Attunement. This weapon has 5 charges and regains them daily at midnight. While attuned to this weapon, you can expend a charge to turn ephemeral, granting you the ability to walk through objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain until the end of your turn. If you end your turn inside an object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can magically melt the moongold before solidifying it, switching between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the equalizer is a flintlock. In its transformed state, the weapon is an ornate, two-handed weapon; a rifle.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. This flintlock has the Barrel 2 (F) property. In addition, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature or targeting a prone creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with this flintlock.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. When you attack with this weapon, you can choose to replace your attack with a particularly violent shot. Make a ranged weapon attack and expend up to 5 charges. On a hit, the target takes the weapon's damage plus an extra 2d8 piercing damage + an extra 1d8 radiant damage for each charge expended. If you expended more than 2 charges for the attack, the target is also blinded until the end of its next turn. Hit or miss, this causes the weapon to partially liquefy and turn back into its untransformed state; it can’t be transformed again until the end of your next turn.</text>
		<text />
		<text>You can use this attack only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use this attack, your speed is 0 until the end of your turn.</text>

		<text>Weapons: scythe, longbow</text>

		<text>If you cast the light cantrip targeting this weapon, the carved runes activate. For the duration of the spell, as long as you hold the weapon, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, and you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick weapon. The Faux Lunaire is a wickedly curved scythe crafted from an arcane alloy and engraved with lunar imagery and celestial runes. With a swift, spinning motion, the limbs of the blade and shaft of the scythe fold in and rotate around the grip, locking into place to form an ornate longbow. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. As part of the bonus action, you can also magically teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. In its untransformed state, this weapon is a scythe. In its transformed state, it’s a longbow.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this weapon, you can force it to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, becoming affected by the faerie fire spell on a failure. You do not need to concentrate on this spell, but it ends early if you put another creature under the effect of the spell, or if you fall unconscious.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. In its transformed state, the Faux Lunaire has 2 charges. When you attack a creature with this bow, you can expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17) from it (no action required): moonbeam or darkness. The spell is centered on the creature’s space and lasts until the end of your next turn. You do not need to concentrate on it, and you can only have one of these spells active at a time. If your attack misses, you expend the charge but the effect fails. The Faux Lunaire regains 1 expended charge each time it is targeted by the light cantrip.</text>

		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the claw is a sinewy leather gauntlet, made from the muscle and hide of a galvanized prowler. In its transformed state, the claw surges with electrical energy, merging with its wearer’s forearm and turning into a monstrous claw.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. The bestial hide invigorates you, giving you the lightning fast reflexes of the galvanized prowler slaughtered to make this gauntlet; you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, this gauntlet feeds off of your power. If you have temporary hit points when you hit with a melee attack, you deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	The gauntlet has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you take lighting or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to instead take no damage and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you would have taken.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. The gauntlet merges with your form, turning your hand into an aberrant claw that you cannot be disarmed of. This claw changes the damage of your unarmed strikes to 1d8, the damage type to slashing, and you can use your Dexterity or Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls made with it. Further, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	When you use the Attack action with this claw, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action. In addition, if you have temporary hit points, when you hit with a melee attack using this claw, you deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage.</text>

		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the guillotine is two one-handed weapons—a longsword and a shortsword. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single one-handed weapon—shears. As part of this bonus action, you can do the following:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; When transforming the swords into shears: you can make a single melee weapon attack with the shears. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative, and you can't use the Guillotine property on this attack.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; When transforming the shears into swords: you can slide the longsword forward as part of dismounting it, making a single melee weapon attack with it. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you have the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you can ignore this limitation.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. While wielding both swords, the longsword is considered light. The shortsword deals your choice of slashing or piercing damage. Whenever you damage a creature with both swords on the same turn, it takes extra slashing damage equal to your choice of either your Strength or Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1).</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. The shears are a one-handed martial weapon that deals 1d12 slashing damage on a hit and scores a critical hit on a 19 or 20. In addition, it has the Guillotine property.</text>

		<text>	Guillotine. Immediately after hitting a target with the shears, if you have a free hand, you can use your reaction to pull the lever, snapping the blades together and dealing an extra 1d12 slashing damage to the target. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, you deal an extra 3d12 slashing damage. If this attack deals more than one quarter of a creature's hit point maximum, you also chop off one the creature's limbs (anything but the head) at the GM's discretion. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is decapitated.</text>

		<name>Trick Weapon: Improved Phantom Limb</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<detail>very rare (requires attunement)</detail>
		<text>Weapons: unarmed, shortsword</text>
		<text />
		<text>Attunement. When you attune to this item, the cold, lifeless hand merges with your flesh and either replaces a missing arm or consumes one of your existing arms (your choice when you attune to this weapon). An arm consumed in this way does not reappear when you unattune from the item.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the phantom limb is a metallic, articulating hand. In its transformed state, the weapon is a shortsword.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. Unarmed strikes you make with the phantom limb deal magical bludgeoning damage. If a creature damaged by your unarmed strikes has an ability that would allow it to walk through objects and creatures (such as a ghost’s incorporeal movement), it loses that ability until the start of your next turn. In addition, the limb reacts to deflect incoming blows, granting you a +2 bonus to AC.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this shortsword, which gains the Haunting Mark property. While the weapon is in this form, you can’t be possessed.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Haunting Mark. Whenever you hit an undead creature with an attack using this blade then, for the next minute, you can see its form as a glowing outline, even if it is invisible, and you always know the direction and distance to the creature while it is on the same plane as you. This effect ends early if you hit a different undead creature with an attack using this blade, or if the phantom limb is no longer in its transformed state.</text>

		<text>Weapons: glaive</text>
		<text />
		<text>Any creature that attunes to this glaive is considered proficient with it. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the gazer is a glaive. In its transformed state, the gazer is a glaive which can be used as a spellcasting focus.</text>
		<text />
		<text>To transform this weapon, you must feed it your blood: each time you shift this weapon into its transformed state, or start your turn with the glaive in its transformed state, you take 1d4 necrotic damage, which cannot be reduced in any way. This damage cannot break your concentration.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. While the glaive is in its untransformed state, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making attack rolls using the glaive.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. While the glaive is in its transformed state, it grants you a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls, increases your spell save DC by 1, and gives you truesight out to 30 feet. Further, while you aren't incapacitated, you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see.</text>

		<name>Trick Weapon: Maiden's Osteosymbiosis</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<detail>very rare (requires attunement)</detail>
		<text>Weapons: special</text>
		<text />
		<text>Head and spine severed from a Cloistered Maiden, the first wielder of this accursed weapon was considered insane, even amongst madmen—after all, the difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits. To control the osteosymbiosis, one must fuse their arm to the bony corpse of an abomination of nature and pray that the gods won’t punish this crime against creation.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Attunement. When you attune to this item, the warm, still moving spine merges with the bones in your arm and replaces them. Bones consumed in this way do not reappear when you unattune from the item.</text>
		<text />
		<text>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it has the Bone Explosion property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the osteosymbiosis is embedded in your flesh, with spikes protruding from your knuckles, changing your unarmed strikes. In its transformed state, it generates a weapon made of bones. When it transforms, roll a d8 to determine the weapon’s type, according to the table below. You are proficient with all the forms of this weapon.</text>
		<text />
		<text>D8 | Weapon</text>
		<text>1 | Battleaxe</text>
		<text>2 | Maul</text>
		<text>3 | Lance</text>
		<text>4 | Longsword</text>
		<text>5 | Rapier</text>
		<text>6 | Flail</text>
		<text>7 | Whip</text>
		<text>8 | Pike</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. Your unarmed attacks deal an extra 1d8 piercing damage. Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with an unarmed strike, you can rupture the bone spikes that grow from your hands, leaving them embedded in your prey. You deal an extra 1d4 piercing damage to your target and it gains 1 bone shard. Your bone protrusions regrow immediately.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. Your attacks with this weapon deal an extra 1d4 slashing damage and score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20. Further, the osseous nature of this armament renders it frail. If you score a critical hit against a creature, the weapon breaks upon the target's flesh, dealing an extra 4d4 piercing damage, and the target gains 4 bone shards. The weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Bone Explosion. As a bonus action, you can detonate all the bone shards embedded in one of your prey. If the target is dead, the shards fail to detonate. Each creature other than you within 15 feet of the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 1d4 piercing damage for each bone shard that detonated. On a success, it takes half as much damage. The bone shards shatter into dust and disappear. A creature with more than 2 bone shards embedded in its body has disadvantage on this saving throw.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Maiden’s Curse: While attuned to this weapon, when a Blood Moon of Rebirth rises, the maiden’s curse awakens and spreads to its owner. You must make a Wisdom saving throw against the Madness DC of the moon. If your character has a womb—or has ever had a womb in their body—on a failure, the weapon merges with you completely and you turn into a Cloistered Maiden under the GM’s control. If you never had a womb, on a failure, instead of transforming, you die.</text>

		<text>Weapons: morning star</text>
		<text />
		<text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In both states, the weapon is a morningstar with the reach property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. The flowers growing in the cradle exude a sickly sweet scent that calms the mind of men and chases away nightmares. Humanoids within 10 feet of the cradle have advantage on saving throws against the charmed and frightened condition. In addition, the cradle has the Vile Miasma and Cleansing Miasma properties.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Vile Miasma. When you hit a beast or an undead with orphan's cradle, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute, even if the target is immune to the poisoned condition. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Vile Miasma for the next 24 hours.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Cleansing Miasma. As an action, you can cleanse one humanoid you can see within 10 feet of you. It gains 1d12 temporary hit points and can end one of the following conditions: charmed, frightened, or poisoned. Once a creature has benefited from this property, it can't benefit from it again for 1 hour.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. When transformed, the cradle's plants ignite, and it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage on a hit. In addition, the weapon gains the Fanned Flames and Withering Flames properties.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Fanned Flames. As an action you can rotate the cradle wildly around you, fanning the flames. Each creature in a 20-foot cone in front of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Beasts and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. After using this property, orphan's cradle reverts to its untransformed state and can't be transformed again for 1d4-1 rounds.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Withering Flames. When you hit a beast or an undead with orphan's cradle, you can force the target to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes vulnerable to your choice of one of the following damage types until the start of its next turn: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or radiant. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cradle's Withering Flames for the next 24 hours.</text>

		<name>Trick Weapon: Phantasmal Executioner</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<detail>very rare (requires attunement)</detail>
		<text>Weapons: scythe, maul</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the executioner is a scythe and a lantern. In its transformed state, weapon is a single massive maul.</text>
		<text />
		<text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. When you hit a creature with the scythe, as part of the same attack, you can choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach to attack. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your initial hit. If you do so, your speed is halved until the end of your turn. In addition, the executioner has the Harvest property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Harvest. Whenever a creature of CR 1 or higher (or 1st level or higher) dies within 15 feet of you, the lantern harvests the creature’s soul. The soul becomes trapped in the lantern and the creature cannot be resurrected until the soul is freed. As an action, you can free a soul trapped in the lantern. The lantern can hold a maximum of three souls.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. The maul gains the Soul Explosion and Undying Light properties.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Soul Explosion. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can sacrifice one of the souls held in the lantern to create a massive explosion of ghostflame, permanently destroying the soul. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 radiant damage and 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Undying Light. If the lantern is holding at least one soul, the maul sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Each creature of your choice that enters the bright light for the first time on a turn or start its turn there must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you until the start of its next turn. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.</text>

		<type>W</type>
		<detail>artifact (requires attunement by a creature with a Strength of 15 or higher)</detail>
		<text>Weapons: cleaver, whip</text>
		<text />
		<text>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While attuned to it, your sight improves as your vision starts echoing with that of the blade. While holding prophecy, you gain the following benefits:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; You can't be surprised.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; Other creatures don't gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being unseen by you.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You are immune to being blinded, as the sword absorbs the effect and closes two of its eyes instead, before regrowing them.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You have truesight out to 30 feet.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You can cast the arcane eye spell at will, requiring no material components and using prophecy as your spellcasting focus. When cast in this way, the magical eye also has truesight out to 30 feet.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the weapon is a cleaver studded with eyeballs. In its transformed state, the weapon is a whip composed of metal shards held together by a sinew of blood and flesh.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. When you hit a creature with this cleaver, you curse them for the next hour. For the duration, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls made with the weapon against the target, any attack roll you make with the weapon against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20 on the d20, and you have advantage on any Perception or Survival check you make to find the target. The curse ends early if you transform the weapon or if you fall unconscious.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. This whip deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit, has the versatile (1d6/1d8) property, but does not have the finesse property. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can attempt to crush them under the weight of the whip. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or take 3d6 slashing damage and be knocked prone and restrained.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Curse: All Devouring Sight. While attuned to this weapon, your sight deteriorates rapidly. For each five days that pass, you gain a permanent -1 penalty to all Perception checks made using your sight. When this penalty reaches -5, your eyes rot and melt out, leaving you permanently blinded as two new eyes appear on the blade. However when you kill a creature of a CR equal to your level or greater, if the creature had eyes, your curse’s penalty regresses by 1 (e.g., from -2 penalty to -1) to a minimum of 0.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	The sword's curse is insidious: while you remain attuned to the weapon, you do not suffer the penalty to your Perception checks, and you do not realize that your sight is worsening. The blade's influence makes you perceive the world in a clearer light. Demidritches are immune to this curse.</text>

		<text>Weapons: whip, rapier</text>
		<text />
		<text>You have a +2 to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this weapon.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Attunement. When you attune to this weapon, the cold, lifeless snake wraps around your forearm and bites your flesh, burying its head beneath it and inflicting 1d4 piercing damage. While attuned, you cannot be disarmed of this magical weapon. Ending the attunement causes the head to retract and the item to fall to the ground.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the bladewhip is a metallic whip. In its transformed state, the weapon solidifies by coagulating your blood to form a rapier.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. Attacks you make with the python bladewhip add an additional 5 feet to your reach, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. In addition, if you hit a creature twice in a turn with this weapon, the whip's devouring hunger awakens and tears out more of its flesh, dealing an extra 4d4 slashing damage, and at the start of the target’s next turn, it takes an extra 2d4 slashing damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. While transformed, you take 1 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns as the blade drains your blood to empower itself. In addition, you gain immunity to the poisoned condition and to curses from spells (such as from bestow curse). This rapier gains the Fireblood Poison property and is considered silvered.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Fireblood Poison. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack using this blade, you can coat the wound with poison and the target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is poisoned for the next minute as its innards start to boil. This can affect creatures immune to the poisoned condition. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 3d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. This damage ignores resistance to fire damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the blade's Fireblood Poison for the next 24 hours.</text>

		<text>Made of an unknown metal that mixes blood and steel, this ghastly sword is studded with dozens of eyes from various creatures that stare hungrily at all who are confronted with it. Only a competent hunter can wield a weapon of such weight, but armed with it, they will never lose sight of their prey and will never be caught in an ambush. Such a dangerous weapon should only be used with the utmost caution.</text>
		<text />
		<text>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While attuned to it, your sight improves as your vision starts echoing with that of the blade. While holding revelations, you gain the following benefits:</text>

		<text>Untransformed. When you hit a creature with this cleaver, you curse them for the next hour. For the duration, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls made with the weapon against the target, any attack roll you make with the weapon against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20, and you have advantage on any Perception or Survival check you make to find the target. The curse ends early if you transform the weapon or if you fall unconscious.</text>
		<text />

		<text>Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</text>
		<text>	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see "Improvised Weapons"). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Loading: Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</text>

		<name>Trick Weapon: Shard of Moonlight</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<detail>artifact (requires attunement)</detail>
		<text>Weapons: longsword, greatsword</text>
		<text />
		<text>This weapon is the flesh of a Great One carved away in pain and fashioned into a blade. The Shard of Moonlight is the reason the fractured moon exists and the devouring moon is no more. He who wields the blade is overwhelmed by hope, however misguided it might be…</text>
		<text />
		<text>While attuned to this weapon, you gain the following benefits:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; You are proficient with greatswords and longswords.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and the blade deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage on a hit.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, except those made to resist madness.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You can use this shard as a spellcasting focus.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Sentience. The Shard of Moonlight is a sentient weapon, with the same personality as the Great One whose flesh it was carved from. The weapon sporadically communicates telepathically with its wielder through images and sounds, though it doesn’t speak.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a metallic longsword that absorbs light. In its transformed state, the weapon is a greatsword that pulses with lunar energy. In both states, this weapon has the light property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. The blade seems to guide your strikes. Once on each of your turns when when you make an attack with the shard, you can immediately make a second attack (no action required). It has the Void Absorption property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Void Absorption. The void that fills the blade is capable of absorbing magic. While holding the untransformed shard, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting you, including spells with an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy—not the spell itself— is stored in the shard in the form of charges. The number of charges gained is equivalent to the level of the spell when it was cast (minimum of 1 for cantrips). The shard can absorb and store up to 10 charges. If the shard doesn’t have enough empty charges for a spell, it fails to absorb it. The blade regains all charges each time the moon changes.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. To transform this blade, you must use a bonus action while under direct moonlight. The transformation lasts for 1 minute, or until you end it early as a bonus action. When it transforms, you can expend the charges stored within the blade, and when the blade loses all charges, the transformation ends. While the blade is transformed, the extra radiant damage it deals on a hit increases from 1d6 to 2d6.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Each time you make an attack in the transformed state, you can expend a number of charges to create special effects:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; Revealing Glow. As part of making an attack, you can expend 1 charge to empower the shard. On a hit, it deals an extra 1d12 radiant damage, and until the start of your next turn, the target sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. While affected by the light, attack rolls against the target have advantage if the attacker can see them, and the affected target can't turn invisible.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; Transient Moonlight. As part of making an attack, you can expend 2 charges to release a wave of moonlight where the shard slashes, creating a 5-foot-wide, 60-footlong line of moonlight in front of you. A creature in the path of the moonlight must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d12 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; Lunar Explosion. Instead of making an attack, you can expend 3 charges to raise the shard upward and release a burst of moonlight energy. Each creature within 30 feet of you must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d12 radiant damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone on a successful one. If a creature falls prone within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to immediately make a melee weapon attack against them with the shard.</text>

		<name>Trick Weapon: Sword of the Radiant Watcher</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<detail>artifact (requires attunement)</detail>
		<text>Weapons: longsword</text>
		<text />
		<text>The Sword of the Radiant Watcher is an ancient weapon, meant to contain two entities bound into eternal hatred. One was a hunter and one was a beast, though no one knows which aspect of the blade they were bound to.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Sentience. This sentient weapon has two distinct personalities, each linked to its corresponding transformed state. The Angelic personality (alignment: lawful good) is protective and nurturing, while the Hateful personality (alignment: chaotic evil) is cunning and ruthless. The weapon has an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The dominant personality may attempt to influence the wielder's actions, particularly when it comes to matters of morality or strategy. However, the sword cannot force its wielder to act against their will. The sword communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Deep Speech.</text>
		<text />
		<text>As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon by letting hatred or hope overwhelm you. In both states, the weapon is a longsword. When the weapon's form changes, so too does its dominant personality.</text>
		<text />
		<text>The two personalities within the Sword of the Radiant Watcher are in constant struggle for dominance. When the wielder attempts to switch the weapon’s forms, they must exert their force of will to do so, making a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a success, the sword changes form, and on a failure, it stubbornly refuses to do so until the start of your next turn, at which point you can attempt to switch the weapon’s forms again.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed: Light Form. The Angelic personality is dominant and the sword deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Curse of Light. When you hit a creature with this sword, you can bind the target to your light (no action required). For the next minute, you are under the effect of the sanctuary spell, but only the bound target must make the saving throw. This effect ends as normal if you take an action that would break it but returns at the start of your next turn.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Retribution of Light. When a target is under the effect of the Curse of Light, as a bonus action, you can bolster up to four creatures of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet for the duration of the curse. While bolstered, they have advantage on their first attack roll against the target each turn, and if the attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to their proficiency bonus of the damage type they dealt. This property of the weapon can be used three times, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed: Shadow Form. The Hateful personality is dominant and the sword deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Shadow Chain. When you hit a creature with this sword, you can tether the target to you with a chain of shadowy energy (no action required). While tethered, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and neither you nor the creature can willingly move or teleport more than 30 feet away from each other. The tether lasts for 1 minute, until you use this property on another creature, if you start your turn more than 30 feet away from the target, or end the tether as a bonus action.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Shadow Consumption. While tethered to a creature with your Shadow Chain, once on each of your turns when you hit the target with this weapon, you can inflict an extra 3d6 necrotic damage and gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. This property of the weapon can be used three times, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Aborrhant Existence. The sentient entities within the sword are antithetical to each other, and no creature can withstand their presence at once, which is why the blade was sealed in such a way. Once on each of your turns, if both forms of the sword damage the same creature in a single turn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	In addition, if you deal necrotic damage with the shadow form of sword while the Curse of Light is in effect; or oppositely, if you deal radiant damage with the light form of the sword while the Shadow Chain is in effect, the effect ends and detonates. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage and 2d6 necrotic damage as the antithetical energies resonate and self-destruct. You have advantage on this saving throw.</text>

		<text>While attuned to this weapon, you gain the following benefits:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit. When you hit a creature with blood with this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d8 necrotic damage.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You are immune to poison and necrotic damage and the poisoned condition.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You know the exact location of any creature with blood within a 30-foot radius, even if they are invisible or on the Ethereal plane.</text>
		<text />
		<text>The weapon has the Lifestealing property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Lifestealing. In dire situations, the épée grants you the power to take the life of others. If you are reduced to one-quarter of your hit points or fewer, you can immediately use this property (no action required).</text>
		<text />
		<text>Until the end of your next turn, whenever you deal damage using this weapon, you regain hit points equal to the damage dealt. Once this property of the weapon has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a vile longsword glowing with echoes of blood. In its transformed state, the weapon is a greatsword with an even more nefarious aspect.</text>
		<text />
		<text>To transform this weapon, you must feed it blood. Each time you deal damage with this weapon to a creature that possesses blood, the épée gains 1 charge. The épée can hold up to 6 charges. Each charge lasts for 1 minute or until it is consumed. If this weapon has 1 or more charges, you can use your bonus action to transform it.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. You gain a 1d12 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that are at their hit point maximum. In addition, the weapon has the Blood Shield property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Blood Shield. The épée forms a barrier of blood around you with the blood it has absorbed. You gain a +1 bonus to AC for each 2 charges within the épée.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. You gain a 1d6 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that are below their hit point maximum. In this form, the épée sanguine consumes 1 charge at the end of each of your turns, unless you've expended 1 or more charges that turn. It reverts back to its untransformed state if it loses all charges.</text>
		<text />
		<text>When you hit a creature with an attack using the épée, you can expend 1 or more charges to unleash the blood accumulated in the blade:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; 1 Charge. You heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; 2 Charges. You deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage and heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; 3 Charges. The target becomes bound in blood and must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d6 necrotic damage and is restrained until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; 4 Charges. Blood covers the creature’s face and chokes it. The creature must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d10 necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned.</text>

		<type>W</type>
		<detail>artifact (requires attunement)</detail>
		<text>Weapons: greatsword, shortsword</text>
		<text />
		<text>The method to create the Épée Solaire is a tight-lipped secret, involving harnessing the power of the sun, a method that only devout followers of the Radiant One can grasp. As time went on, the sun faded from the skies of Luyarnha, replaced by a never ending night, and so, the creation of this weapon became impossible. This Épée Solaire was bathed in the blood of the sun, unleashing its potential.</text>
		<text />
		<text>While attuned to this weapon, you gain the following benefits:</text>
		<text />
		<text>	&#8226; You are proficient with greatswords and shortswords.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit. When you hit an aberration or undead with it, the extra radiant damage increases to 2d8.</text>
		<text>	&#8226; You have advantage on saving throws against madness.</text>
		<text />
		<text>The weapon’s blade emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight. You can summon or extinguish the light at will (no action required). Each creature of your choice in the light has resistance to radiant damage. This weapon has the Deflective Light property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Deflective Light. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to cause a burst of sunlight to flare before the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll and transforming the weapon. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Trick Weapon. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a metallic greatsword glowing with light. In its transformed state, the weapon is two shortswords emitting the same glow.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Untransformed. While wielding this greatsword, your senses are pushed to their limit. You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws. In addition, the weapon has the Light of Judgment property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Light of Judgment. As a bonus action, you can unleash judgment upon the heretics. The blade’s light is summoned for the next minute or until you fall unconscious or transform the weapon. You and all hostile creatures within the bright light immediately take 2d8 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage whenever you damage a creature with the épée, and radiant damage you deal ignores resistance to radiant damage.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Transformed. When you engage in two-weapon fighting with these shortswords, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. In addition, this weapon gains the Sunscorch property.</text>
		<text />
		<text>	Sunscorch. Whenever you hit a creature two times in a turn with these shortswords, the accumulated solar energy detonates. Each creature in a 15-foot radius must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

			<text>Beneath the translucent skin of the nebulare flit constellations of multihued lights: galaxy-like swirls and nebulous clouds. In times of great peril, these colourful displays can erupt in a supernova-like display of radiant brilliance, creating localised gravitational fields that help ensure the escape, and continued proliferation, of the nebular demidritch. Though the progenitor of the nebulare, an Outer God, has created no new nabulare for some time, the bloodline can go dormant for several generations, manifesting seemingly at random among newborns. Of course, with the Radiant Church experimentation in full swing, whether or not the recurrence of nebulare is really at random is an unanswered question.</text>

			<text>The person who schemes and creates a web of lies around themselves is, unsurprisingly, bound to turn into an arenea. Also known as half-spiders, these scourgeborne differ from others - though many turn, few retain their sanity. Amongst the scourgeborne, areneas are the least trusted, their appearance revealing their former - or current - manipulative personality. Although most citizens understand the need for violence, especially in Luyarnha, none tolerate deception and betrayal.</text>

This is a path that calls for a certain madness that is only found in the most ardent of hunters, those who feel the burning need to reach the pinnacle of power and will do anything to achieve it.

				<name>Primal Path: Path of the Earthbreaker</name>
				<text>In a time long past, the power to command gravity was stolen and disseminated throughout the destitute underbelly of Luyarnha, much like the mythical theft of fire from the heavens. Within the ranks of the Forsaken, many have embraced the spatial magic as a tool of mass destruction, unleashing it upon beasts and mortals with a ruthlessness particular to those who have nothing to lose. Among them, the Earthbreakers stand imperious; barbarians with a natural affinity for the void, capable of leveling buildings in their rage, these living titans are coveted prizes. Many factions seek to bend their wills for their own ends, and if such control proves impossible, death is an all too frequent outcome.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Whether from innate talent, intense training, or cursed rituals, all Earthbreakers share the same path of destruction, crushing their foes and grinding them to dust. Earthbreakers thrive in the middle of the battlefield, where they break their enemies, drag their face on the pavement, and leave behind naught but a mess of blood and brain. It is pointless to hide from them, for they are capable of shattering the very foundations of the world to unearth their quarry. The power to reshape the world—to bend and break it at a whim—is one many desire, yet few master it like Earthbreakers do.</text>

				<text>Starting at 3rd level, you have learned to channel destructive energy through your fists and other body parts.

				<text />
				<text>Earthbreaker save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier</text>

				<text>	&#8226; Bulldozing Punch. You push the target 10 feet away from you or upward. If pushed into an obstacle or another creature, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 1).

The range of these abilities, and the distance they move creatures, doubles at 14th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	&#8226; Attractive Field. You unleash a gravitational wave. Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet towards you.</text>

Each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you. If this pushes the attacker beyond its reach of you, the attack misses you. If the bubble doesn’t burst by the start of your next turn, it harmlessly dissipates.</text>
				<text />

In addition, hit or miss, the area in a 90-foot cone in front of you breaks, as per the earthquake spell (save DC equals your Earthbreaker save DC), although the spell only lasts until the start of your next turn, doesn’t require concentration, and can create only 1d4 fissures in the area.</text>

				<name>Primal Path: Path of the Lightning Vessel</name>
				<text>A Lightning Vessel is a brute, a monster of battle. Their bodies overflowing with lightning, they arrive unexpectedly, often dropping from buildings or leaping impossible distances, before crashing down amidst the fight. The presence of a single Lightning Vessel is often enough to turn the tides of battle. Their ferocious electricity rampaging through their enemies, leaving a trail of charred corpses in their wake. If one ends up face to face against such a monster, there is no running away—they will catch you, electrocute you, and rend your corpse. Although vital in the fight against the Scourge, their recklessness causes fear in the heart of friends and foes alike.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The Scions created the Lightning Vessels, using galvanized rods implanted within the spine of newborns, before subjecting them to violent shock therapy. Of those children, a few grew capable of harnessing lightning, while many more were crippled for life—a small price to pay for salvation. This very technology was later used to create the Galvanized Prowlers, mortal enemies of the Lightning Vessels, as the Scions started fearing their own creation.</text>

				<text>Lightning is part of you. It flows through your veins and awaits release. At 3rd level, you gain resistance to lightning damage. If you already have this resistance, instead, if you take lightning damage, you can reduce that damage by 1d6 (after the resistance applies).</text>
				<text />
				<text>In addition, while raging, you can unleash the lightning within. For the duration of your rage, you can use your bonus action to unleash various powers.</text>

				<text>Saving Throws. Some of your abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Vessel save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>	&#8226; Electrified Chains. You can use your bonus action to create chains of lightning that wrap around your weapon. The next time you hit a creature this turn, it takes additional lightning damage equal to twice your Constitution modifier and becomes ensnared by the chains, which anchor to the floor, until the start of your next turn. Each time it attempts to move more than 10 feet while ensnared, it must make an Athletics check contested by your Athletics check, freeing itself on a success. On a failure, it takes the lightning damage again and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	&#8226; Fulgurant Strike. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can leave the weapon embedded in their chest for a brief moment and immediately use a bonus action to call down lightning from the heavens to strike them, using the weapon as a conduit, before retrieving it. The target takes lightning damage equal to twice your Constitution modifier, and all creatures within a 5-foot radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Vessel save DC or also take that damage. You have advantage on this saving throw.</text>

During this rush, your body becomes supercharged; if you end this movement within 5 feet of a creature, it takes lightning damage equal to twice your Constitution modifier as the lightning leaps to them. If there are multiple creatures, choose one that takes the damage.</text>

				<name>Roaring Crash (Path of the Lightning Vessel)</name>
				<text>At 6th level, you are ready to leap into battle at a moment’s notice, crashing down on your foes like thunder from the heavens. As part of entering your rage, you can leap into the air, before crashing down on a point on the ground that you can see within 30 feet of you that isn't occupied by a Huge or larger creature. All creatures in a 10-foot radius centered on that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Vessel save DC or take a number of d8s of lightning damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1d8), or half as much damage on a success.</text>
				<text />
				<text>If a creature is in the space on which you land, they have disadvantage on the saving throw and are pushed 5 feet out of your space into an unoccupied space of their choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in your space.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	At 10th level, the distance you can leap increases to 60 feet, and you can land in spaces occupied by Huge creatures. At 14th level, the distance increases to 90 feet, and you can land in spaces occupied by Gargantuan creatures.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips:</text>
				<text>	You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots:</text>
				<text>	The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
				<text>	You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</text>
				<text>	You learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
				<text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
				<text>	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ritual Casting:</text>
				<text>	You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
				<text>	You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</text>

				<text>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</text>
				<text>	Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</text>
				<text>	You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</text>

				<text>Apocalypse bards are masters at conjuring forth the ancient powers of eldritch gods, summoning forth their otherworldly might to wreak havoc on the mortal realm. All who hear their aberrant harmonies fear and revere them—they understand that with a single whisper, these bards can cause the end of all things. Apocalypse bards are often found on the front lines of battle, their music serving as a rallying cry for their allies and a death knell for their enemies. With each stanza they produce, a member of the College of the Apocalypse draws closer to the ultimate revelation of the horrors that lie beyond the veil. Many fear the day when they will finally succumb to the madness that gnaws within their mind.</text>
				<text />
				<text>As they progress in their studies, members of this bard college gain the ability to summon forth devastating powers with their music. They can call down swarms of pain, tear open rifts in reality, and unleash waves of madness upon their foes. They know the apocalypse is coming, for they are the ones bringing it.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the cleric spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips:</text>
				<text>	At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
				<text>	The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier+your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
				<text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ritual Casting:</text>
				<text>	You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
				<text>	You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</text>

				<name>Divine Domain</name>
				<text>Choose one domain related to your deity: Guardian Domain. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Domain Spells:</text>
				<text>	Each domain has a list of spells &#8212; its domain spells &#8212; that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&#8217;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</text>
				<text>	If you have a domain spell that doesn&#8217;t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</text>

				<text>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</text>
				<text>	When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</text>
				<text>	Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</text>
				<text>	Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</text>

				<text>	A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can&#8217;t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can&#8217;t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.

				<name>Divine Domain: Guardian Domain</name>
				<text>Clerics of the Radiant Church are venerated as saint-like figures, and those who walk the path of the guardian even more so. Such overwhelming praise was only heightened by the arrival of the scourge, and the countless heroic actions performed by the Church anchored it as a beacon of salvation in the heart of the citizens of Luyarnha. This abundant reverence has its risks, of course, though few dare point it out; a zealous crowd is best left well alone.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Guardian domain clerics were the first to jump into combat against the beasts, and to this day haven't backed down from the battle, despite the pain and loss they have endured. Their protective spirit is embodied in their magic—summoning guardian angels—which swoop to their side, protecting any who would ask under their wings. Although the features of these angels can be unsettling, none would dare doubt their intentions.</text>

Some angels take the form of a humanoid angelic figure dressed with pure garments, while many others espouse a more eldritch appearance.</text>
				<text />
				<text>In combat, the angel shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the angel can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</text>

				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
				<text>	The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier+your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
				<text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>

				<name>Wild Shape</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>	Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table (Player&#8217;s Handbook, p. 66).</text>
				<text>	At 2nd level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn&#8217;t have a flying or swimming speed. At 4th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that doesn&#8217;t have a flying speed. At 8th level, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower.</text>
				<text>	You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</text>
				<text>	While you are transformed, the following rules apply.</text>
				<text />
				<text>&#8226; Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&#8217;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&#8217;t use them.</text>
				<text />
				<text>&#8226; When you transform, you assume the beast&#8217;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&#8217;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&#8217;t knocked unconscious.</text>

				<text>&#8226; You can&#8217;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&#8217;t break your concentration on a spell you&#8217;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you&#8217;ve already cast.</text>
				<text />
				<text>&#8226; You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&#8217;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</text>
				<text />
				<text>&#8226; You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&#8217;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&#8217;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&#8217;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</text>

				<name>Druid Circle: Circle of Symbiosis</name>
				<text>The Circle of Symbiosis allows druids devoted to Nature to become one with it—in the most real sense of the word. These druids have mastered osteomancy and use it to sever their own limbs and replace them with fragments of the natural world. To become “awakened symbiotic entities”, something others would decry as aberrations, they graft one or multiple limbs to their body. Deer hind-legs replace their own, tree branches take over their arms, and the most devoted and zealous replace their head with that of an animal.</text>
				<text />
				<text>By reveling in such powers, the Circle of Symbiosis seeks to make all living beings one with Nature, or else. No sacrifice is too great for the cause. As such, even children of the Circle are forced to undergo these often deadly abscissions, developing their rampaging powers soon after and with great affinity. As these druids age, they become indistinguishable from their grafts, their humanity slowly waning to make way for something more implacable, more unyielding. Their practices have shunned them from most civilized locales, a punishment that hasn’t stopped them from recruiting—or abducting —more to join their cause.</text>

				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can unleash the vicious natural powers held amidst your flesh. As an action, you may expend a use of your Wild Shape to awaken Nature’s anger, turning into a behemoth, rather than transforming into a beast form. A deer skull, wooden skin, goat hooves, or other such natural gifts overtake your body. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:</text>
				<text />
				<text>	&#8226; Your arms count as clubs, each under the effect of the shillelagh spell.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	&#8226; You are under the effect of the barkskin spell, although you do not need to concentrate on it. In addition, whenever a creature damages you with an attack, your skin splinters and all creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you take 1d4 magical piercing damage. This damage increases to 2d4 at 10th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	&#8226; The stress of battle stimulates your organism to fight and survive. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to half the damage taken since the start of your previous turn (rounded down, minimum of 0), up to a maximum of three times your Wisdom modifier. This regeneration doesn’t work if you are unconscious.</text>
				<text />
				<text>These benefits last for 10 minutes, or until you use your Wild Shape again. You cannot use this transformation if you are wearing armor.</text>

				<name>Martial Archetype: Blood Archer</name>
				<text>Blood archers are cursed beings that should not exist. Birthed from nightmarish experiments by the Obitus Scholare, these hunters use a cursed method of archery, weaving their own blood into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Their powers come from tarblood, an amalgamation of hundreds of species’ blood that was forcefully injected in the veins of hunters. Those who didn’t die or go insane during the procedure became the first blood archers; only they and their descendants can wield this vicious power.</text>

				<name>Martial Archetype: Living Nightmare</name>
				<text>First it was an accident, a hunter dying on a battlefield, in dire need of a transplant. The clerics used what they could find and unknowingly grafted accursed flesh onto the dying man, yet, not only did he survive, he rose again stronger than ever before.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	It was that day the Radiant Church knew that they found a power rivalling that of the very god they worshipped. They took these experiments further, ordering the Obitus Scholare to harness that power. The desperate fight against the scourge demanded urgent results; no act was too sacred nor debauched. And so, the accursed Luyarnha gave birth to living nightmares, monsters of its own creation.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	The experiments have since stopped: indeed, it was far too common to see those grafted with eldritch flesh lose their humanity and turn into the very monsters they were supposed to eradicate. Yet some remain, a few fortunate hunters who retain their sanity, or perhaps, who have yet to awaken their true powers.</text>

				<name>Eldritch Weaponry (Living Nightmare)</name>
				<text>Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can mutate your body, transforming it into various weapons of destruction. They count as simple melee weapons for you, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with them, as normal. When you use these weapons, you drop any items you are holding with those limbs. Some of the Living Nightmare features require your target to make a saving throw; the DC is calculated as follows:</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Living Nightmare save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>You choose the weapon’s form each time you make an attack roll:</text>
				<text />
				<text>Stinger. One of your limbs grows into a razor-sharp blade. It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit. When you take the Attack action to attack with it on your turn, you can use a bonus action to turn another limb into a Stinger and strike with it, making a single additional attack.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Hammer Arm. Your arms turn into a black-tinted bone club. On a hit, it deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage and you can choose to push the target 5 feet away.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Tendinous Lash. One of your limbs replaces its bones with tough coiled ligaments, allowing it to stretch a disturbing distance without breaking. It deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit and has a reach of 15 feet. In addition, the first time on a turn you deal damage with your lash, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Living Nightmare save DC or be knocked prone as the limb sweeps their feet.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Alternatively, you can transform your limb into a shield:</text>
				<text />
				<text>Sinister Aegis. Whenever you are targeted by an attack that you can see, you can use your reaction to temporarily turn one of your arms into a fleshy shield, gaining a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	In addition, your eldritch flesh is capable of devouring some magical items to gain their properties. As part of a short or long rest, you can devour the following types of magic items, absorbing their properties:</text>
				<text />
				<text>- A rapier; its properties are added to your Stinger.</text>
				<text>- A maul; its properties are added to your Hammer Arm.</text>
				<text>- A whip; its properties are added to your Tendinous Lash.</text>
				<text>- A shield; its properties are added to your Sinister Aegis.</text>
				<text />
				<text>If you absorb another magical item of the same type, the previous magic item of that type is destroyed.</text>

When you stand within 5 feet of the corpse of a creature that has died less than 1 week ago, you can use your action to touch it and let your eldritch appendages devour it. You regain a number of hit points equal to the creature’s CR (minimum of 0, rounded down). In addition, for the next 24 hours, you can use an action to assume the creature’s appearance and voice, though none of your game statistics change. You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	After 24 hours, or if you consume another creature, you lose the ability to take the appearance of the consumed being.</text>

				<text>Stinger. You can replace one of your Stinger attacks. Instead, each creature in a 30-foot cone in front of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Living Nightmare save DC or take damage equal to 3 hits from your Stinger.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Hammer Arm. You can replace one of your Hammer Arm attacks. Instead, you smash the ground below you, causing quakes and sending fragments flying. Each creature within 20 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Living Nightmare save DC or take damage equal to 2 hits from your Hammer Arm and be knocked prone.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Tendinous Lash. You can replace one of your Tendinous Lash attacks, swiping those around you instead. Each creature within 15 feet of you must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Living Nightmare save DC or take damage equal to 1 hit from your Lash, be pulled 10 feet in a straight line towards you, and be restrained until the start of your next turn.</text>

				<name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Fire Dancer</name>
				<text>The fire dancers carry an almost extinct tradition. Once a trading group, they considered themselves a family of a single creed: “Those who harm us will bathe in flames."This nomadic group of seasoned warriors welcomed all walks of life, regardless of origin, status, or influence; as long as one conducted oneself with respect towards their fellows, the caravans would open their door. Their ironclad creed and welcoming nature was their downfall.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Upon arriving in Luyarnha, they were accused of bringing the scourge with them. After all, the dancing flames didn’t affect the city before their arrival. This lie, like so many told, carried a kernel of truth that was exploited to bend others to the city’s will. For this sin, they were imprisoned, left to starve, and forbidden from practicing their martial arts.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Such a treatment couldn’t break their will; to hide their practice of martial arts, the traveling band took the name of fire dancers and hid their powers within their dance. For years they have endured, many escaping the prison with the aid of their fellows, yet the bonds of family entrap more firmly than any chain could. Even those who escape refuse to leave the city until their kin are freed and their name is cleared.</text>

				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
				<text>	The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>

When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier+half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>

				<text>	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>

				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Eldritch Hunt</name>
				<text>The Oath of the Eldritch Hunt is sworn to the eradication of the unnatural, the aberrant, and the alien. These hunters tread a fine line, enhancing themselves with their prey’s powers whilst trying to maintain their own sanity. Unfortunately, this frenzied hunger drives many to madness, and it is no rare occurrence for these paladins to have to hunt their own.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	This oath is found most frequently among paladins of the Radiant Order. Erroneously nicknamed grey templars, witch hunters, and knights aberrant, these oftdeformed warriors devote themselves to obliterating the scourge and its creations.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Tenets of the Eldritch Hunt</text>
				<text>Resolve. Through willpower and tenacity, the strain of the hunt is endured; aching limbs and ailing minds are no reason to fall short.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Respect. Take life only when doing so protects others. Kill only when necessary, lest the bloodshed enamour your soul and hunter becomes beast.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Responsibility. Many rely on your talent to survive the moonlit nights. No matter the circumstances, do not fail them. Sacrifice your own body so that others can retain the sanctity of their own, untainted forms.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Oath Spells</text>
				<text>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots:</text>
				<text>	The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
				<text>	You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</text>
				<text>	You learn an additional ranger spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
				<text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
				<text>	Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>

				<name>Ranger Archetype: Lunar Warden</name>
				<text>Lunar Wardens hold a deep fascination for the enigmatic powers of the moons, forming a profound bond with the ever-changing celestial bodies, drawing upon their forms to enhance their abilities. This ancient elven tradition has persisted through the ages, renewing its knowledge with each new moon that manifested itself. These wardens of old learned to harness these new lunar powers, consolidating their wisdom and passing it down through generations. Today, this conclave of stout defenders has become exceedingly rare, with only a sparse few members residing within the city-state's walls. While some whisper that members of this conclave can cleanse the moons of their corruption, the turmoil within Luyarnha suggests otherwise.</text>
				<text />
				<text>By embracing the lunar energies, these rangers undergo a transformation that melds their very essence with that of the moons, adopting aspects of their celestial beauty and might. As their bond with the moons deepens, Lunar Wardens attune themselves to the celestial bodies'forms, allowing them to channel lunar energies in extraordinary ways—mending grievous wounds using the power of a blood moon or burning asunder their foes with the blazing intensity of a scorching moon. When in perfect harmony with the eldritch body looming above, their abilities swell to incredible heights, transforming them into exceptional nocturnal hunters, whereas others would instead seek refuge from the dreadful moons.</text>

				<text>Additionally, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</text>

				<text />

				<name>Ranger Archetype: Torturer Conclave</name>
				<text>Enshrouded within the radiance of Luyarnha, a conclave of rangers lies concealed, their solemn duty vowed to the preservation of peace within the walls, regardless of the means. Ever vigilant against the insidious advance of the scourge, they have honed their inquisitorial craft, recognizing the importance of early prevention of this plague, achieved by finding and interrogating victims, and even potential victims, before signs of sickness manifest themselves.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Although these rangers have been known to serve the clergy and royalty, since the fall of the House of Commons, they are no longer beholden to the fickle desires of any specific lord or lady. Many are now driven by a loftier purpose, one that necessitates the utmost discipline and commitment, for they recognize that if the Scourge is allowed to propagate, it shall wreak havoc upon all they cherish. Yet, some pursue baser ambitions, offering their expertise to those who desire to bend these rangers to their malevolent will, extracting confessions or inflicting retribution upon adversaries. After all, torture, a practice as ancient as the very bedrock of the earth, is a dreadful instrument, potent enough to shatter even the most indomitable of spirits.</text>
				<text />
				<text>In the throes of battle, these rangers bring their torturous expertise with them, employing it with merciless precision to break their enemies, methodically subjecting them to unspeakable agony. They do not recoil from these savage tactics, for they understand that failure means death or a fate grimmer still. They show no mercy to their foes, for they are well aware that none would be extended to them in kind.</text>

				<name>Torturer Techniques (Torturer Conclave)</name>
				<text>Also at 3rd level, you learn to use techniques. Unlike others who require patience and careful preparation, you employ techniques that are fueled by your magic, letting you make use of torture tools even in the midst of hunts. You can use each technique twice and regain the ability to do so again when you finish a long rest, or when you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to reuse it.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Techniques. When you make a melee weapon attack against a creature while you have torture tools in one hand (or a free hand and the presence of torture tools at your disposal, such as strapped around your leg), as part of that attack, you can use a technique to enhance it in some way. You must use the technique before the attack roll is made, and regardless of the outcome, the use or the spell slot is expended. You can only use a technique once per turn, though you can use multiple different techniques in the same turn, and you can only use one technique per attack.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Empowered Techniques. At certain levels in this class, you gain the ability to empower your torturer techniques using magic. When you expend a spell slot to use a technique, you inflict extra damage, and the target suffers a penalty to saving throws it makes against the technique, as shown on the following table. You can’t empower a technique using a spell slot of a level you haven’t unlocked, even if you have higher level spell slots (e.g., through multiclassing or items).</text>
				<text />
				<text>Additionally, the first two times you use a technique after you finish a long rest, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher, in which case the technique is empowered as if you had expended a spell slot one level higher (up to a maximum of the highest spell slot you’ve unlocked).</text>
				<text />
				<text>Saving Throws. Some of your techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Technique save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ranger level | Spell Slot | Unlocked Extra Damage | Saving Throw Penalty</text>
				<text>3 | 1st | Wisdom mod | -1d4</text>
				<text>5 | 2nd | 2 x Wisdom mod | -2d4</text>

				<name>Techniques (Torturer Conclave)</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you learn each of the following techniques. At higher levels, these techniques are improved.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Combing</text>
				<text>You scrape, tear, and flay the victim's flesh. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d12 slashing damage.</text>
				<text>	Starting at 7th level, if you damage a target two rounds in a row with this technique, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your technique save DC. On a failure, you tear away so much flesh that its body starts to bleed deeply. It takes 1d8 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns (this damage can’t be reduced or ignored in any way) for 1 minute. A bleeding creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Any extra damage from empowering this technique also applies to this necrotic damage. A creature can’t suffer multiple instances of this effect at once.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Enucleation</text>
				<text>You aim a vicious strike at the target's eye, reducing their vision to a macabre blur. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d6 of the weapon’s damage type and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on Perception checks and be blinded beyond 60 feet for 1 minute. Any healing ends this effect. The target can repeat this saving throw with disadvantage at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</text>
				<text>	Starting at 11th level, if the target fails its saving throw against this technique two rounds in a row, it becomes blinded for 1 minute. Creatures with more than 2 eyes have advantage on this saving throw. The target can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Hamstringing</text>
				<text>You slash at the tendons. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d8 slashing damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.</text>
				<text>	Starting at 7th level, if the target fails its saving throw against this technique two rounds in a row, you sever its tendons, and its walking speed becomes 0 for 1 minute. The target can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Nerve Scraping</text>
				<text>You damage the target’s nerves, causing its body to writhe in pain. On a hit, it takes an extra 1d8 psychic damage. The target must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose its grip on reality, unable to differentiate friend from foe through the veil of pain; until the start of your next turn, it must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach other than itself. If no creature is within its reach, it acts as normal, though still can’t discern allies and enemies, and if it makes an attack, it randomly determines a target within its reach or range other than itself.</text>
				<text>	Starting at 11th level, if the target fails its saving throw against this technique two rounds in a row, it suffers a 1d4 penalty to its attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute. The target can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Throat Chop</text>
				<text>You deliver a fierce cleave to the target's throat, severely impairing its ability to breathe and speak. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage and can’t speak or use the verbal components of spells until the start of your next turn.</text>
				<text>	Starting at 11th level, if you hit a target two rounds in a row with this technique, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your technique save DC. On a failure, the pain shocks the target, which becomes stunned until the end of your next turn.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Tympanic Rupture</text>
				<text>You slam the target’s ears in an attempt to destabilize it. On a hit, the target takes an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become deafened for 1 minute. A deafened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</text>
				<text>	Starting at 7th level, if the target fails its saving throw against this technique two rounds in a row, it is disoriented for the duration. While disoriented, the target can’t take reactions.</text>

				<text>By 7th level, you’ve seen the worst depravities that plague this world and have committed most of them. You are immune to the frightened condition and gain resistance to psychic damage.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	In addition, if a creature attempts to read your mind or telepathically talk to you against your will, it must first make a Wisdom saving throw against your torture save DC. On a failure, it witnesses the horrors within your mind and fails to communicate with you, taking psychic damage equal to your level. On a success, it must repeat the saving throw after each minute spent reading your mind or telepathically talking to you against your will.</text>

It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your technique save DC or start dissociating your presence, its mind refusing to acknowledge the anguish you are causing it, only perceiving you as a flicker; you become heavily obscured to it for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</text>

				<text>The Blades of Radiance, also called Steel Saints, are known to be one of the most lethal orders of the Church. In order to become a blade, one must be a devout follower of the faith, as only those who would die for the cause are deemed worthy. Prospective members are trained within the walls of the Church, taking on the clergy as their new kin, and discarding whatever familial bonds they might have held onto. Their zealous fervor grants them unrivaled powers on the battlefield, wielding massive weapons as if they were mere toys, infusing their blade with divine powers, and breaking down their foes one by one.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The Blades of Radiance receive an incredibly diverse range of missions. The most brutal of their members handle gruesome matters in a lethal fashion, whereas those of a more empathetic temperament are tasked with protecting their fellows. Despite this sundry in character, they all share one goal: safeguarding the Church and its members, no matter what.</text>

				<text>Also at 3rd level, your devotion to eradicating enemies of the Church is made manifest by the righteous powers you wield. You have a pool of points that you can expend to fuel this divine power called Divine points. The number of points in the pool equals 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You regain all your expended Divine points when you finish a short or long rest. In addition, each time you kill an aberration, beast, fiend, or undead of CR ½ or higher with your sanctified blade, you regain one Divine point. Each time you expend a Divine point you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.</text>

				<text>Saving Throws. Some of your divine attacks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</text>

				<text />

This feature doesn't protect you from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.</text>

On a failure, it suffers a condition until the start of your next turn. If you and the target are in darkness, the target suffers a - 1d6 penalty to its saving throw.

				<text>Spell Slots:</text>
				<text>	The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</text>

				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>

				<text>	You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>

You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>

				<name>Pact Magic</name>
				<text>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the warlock spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips:</text>
				<text>	You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 4th level, and another at 10th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots:</text>
				<text>	The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>	For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
				<text>	At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</text>
				<text>	You learn an additional warlock spell at 2nd through 9th level, and at every odd level thereafter. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what&#8217;s shown in the table&#8217;s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</text>
				<text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
				<text>	Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
				<text>	You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</text>

				<text>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</text>
				<text>	Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</text>
				<text>	You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can&#8217;t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it.

				<text>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class&#8217;s spell list (the three needn&#8217;t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don&#8217;t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don&#8217;t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.</text>
				<text>	If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</text>

				<name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Trigger</name>
				<text>You can use your action to draw upon the powers of your Patron and create a hex gun in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this spellcasting focus takes each time you create it. It can either be a Revolver or a Sniper (detailed below).</text>
				<text>	Your hex gun disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss it (no action required), or if you die.</text>
				<text>	Your hex gun acts as a spellcasting focus, and when you cast cantrips with it, it channels them as bullets (these still count as spells). Instead of increasing the damage of the cantrip when you reach certain levels, you can cast the cantrip additional times as part of the same action (except for Eldritch Blast, which is cast as normal). To be cast in this way, the cantrip must deal damage, must make a spell attack or require a saving throw, and must have a range other than self.</text>
				<text>	When you cast a cantrip in this manner, you cast it 2 times at 5th level, 3 times at 11th level, and 4 times at 17th level. The cantrip can deal its damage more than once, but its other effects can't be applied again.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Revolver Form: Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged spell attack rolls cast through the hex gun. While wielding this weapon, you know the shocking grasp cantrip.</text>
				<text>Sniper Form: Your ranged spell attack rolls cast through the hex gun have their range doubled and ignore half-cover. While wielding this weapon, you know the ray of frost cantrip.</text>

				<text>These warlocks have made a pact with an eldritch being from the deepest depths of the Cosmos—a being that devours energy, holds the secrets of creation, and paves the way to the apocalypse. Pray that they are not aware of your presence. A deep fascination for the cosmos, or perhaps profound meditation on the heat death of the universe could’ve brought about the circumstances that lead to this pact. Very few are able to withstand such knowledge and power, and the few that do are often seen as mysterious and reclusive figures.</text>

				<text>At 1st level, as a bonus action, you can create a miniature black hole, in the form of a 5-foot-radius sphere, centered on a point on the ground that you can see within 60 feet. This black hole has a domain of influence of 10 feet beyond its own radius. It lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). The black hole is considered difficult terrain for all creatures except for you.</text>
				<text>When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the ability ends, unsecured objects within the domain of influence of the miniature black hole are pulled toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.</text>
				<text>As part of creating the sphere, and on subsequent turns as a bonus action, you can choose a creature within the domain of influence of the black hole, increasing the pull of gravity around them. They must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pulled straight toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible. A creature that enters the black hole’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 1d6 magical bludgeoning damage and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.</text>
				<text>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a warlock spell slot to use it again.</text>

				<text>	&#8226; At 3rd level in this class, when a creature enters the black hole's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is restrained for the duration. A restrained creature can attempt to free itself by using an action to make a Athletics check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the black hole and moves to the nearest unoccupied space outside the black hole.</text>
				<text>	&#8226; At 5th level in this class, the domain of influence of the sphere increases to 20 feet and the damage to 2d6. A creature reduced to 0 hit points while inside the black hole is annihilated, along with any nonmagical items it is wearing or carrying.</text>
				<text>	&#8226; At 7th level in this class, the radius of the black hole increases to 10 feet.</text>
				<text>	&#8226; At 9th level in this class, the damage increases to 3d6 and the sphere’s domain of influence to 30 feet. You can summon the black hole at any point that you can see, not just on the ground. If the sphere is in the air, creatures restrained by it hover inside the black hole.</text>

If you roll higher than their attack roll, you deflect the trajectory and the target takes no damage. If you roll lower, you reduce the damage by 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. If you roll a 20, the attack is deflected and streaks towards the center of the black hole, randomly hitting one of the creatures inside, if any are present.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips:</text>
				<text>	At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 4th level, and another at 10th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellbook:</text>
				<text>	At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
				<text>	The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so. choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier+your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you&#8217;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>	You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
				<text>	Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ritual Casting:</text>
				<text>	You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don&#8217;t need to have the spell prepared.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
				<text>	You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
				<text>	Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Source: Player's Handbook p. 114</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>

		<autolevel level="1">
			<feature>
				<name>Spellbook</name>
				<text>The spells of 1st level and higher that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse.Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&#8217;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Copying a Spell into the Book:</text>
				<text>	When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</text>
				<text>	Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</text>
				<text>	For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Replacing the Book:</text>
				<text>	You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book &#8212; for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</text>
				<text>	If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The Book&#8217;s Appearance:</text>
				<text>	Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</text>

The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you&#8217;re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</text>

				<name>Arcane Tradition: Osteomancer</name>
				<text>Osteomancers are powerful wizards who understand the power that can be harvested from bones. Often said to be cursed and talked about under cover of night, this sort of magic makes the uneducated shiver and the scholar morbidly curious. Those who have the cunning, bravery, or simple foolishness to pursue research in this field find themselves rewarded with afflicted knowledge. These accursed souls are known as Osteomancers.</text>
				<text>The abilities of an Osteomancer are unsettling, if not terrifying to most. Due to their focus on manipulating bones, a topic that is cloaked in mystery and taboo, regular folks regard them as cursed and malevolent beings. Those who see their magic at work have compared it to witnessing a puppet master—bending and twisting enemies to their whim. Many people fail to realize that an Osteomancer's favorite puppet is themselves, and that they will readily desecrate their own body in order to crush their opponent.</text>

On a failure, you take total and precise control of its skeleton. Until the end of the creature's next turn, it takes only the actions you choose and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. In the creature’s efforts to resist your command, attack rolls it makes against its allies have disadvantage, and its allies have advantage on saving throws from effects caused by the creature.</text>

The creature can’t resist your command; it doesn’t suffer disadvantage on attacks against its allies, nor do they have advantage on saves against effects caused by the creature. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. You must concentrate on this feature as you would concentrate on a spell, and damage can't break your concentration.</text>

		<text>You cause a cage of cartilage and bones to erupt from the ground that surrounds a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The bones are thick and provide three-quarters cover to creatures inside and outside. When you or any other creature attempts to pass through the cage, you can use your reaction to let them through. Large or Larger creatures cannot enter the cage, and are pushed to the nearest unoccupied space if they are within the cage’s area when it first appears. The osseous cage has AC 12, 100 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. If you cast this spell again while you already have a cage summoned, the previous cage turns to dust.</text>
		<text>	 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the cage has an additional 20 hit points for each slot level above 3rd.</text>

		<text>You flick your finger against a creature. The target is impacted by a devastating gravitational force and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 120 feet away from you. The push stops early if the creature hits a solid surface or is pushed into a creature of its size or larger. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.</text>
		<text>If the target is pushed into or through the space of a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage is increased by 1d10 per size smaller the creature is than the target.</text>
		<text>	At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the target takes an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 30 additional feet for each slot level above 4th.</text>
		<text>	Note: For example, if a commoner (size Medium) is pushed into a frog (size Tiny), the frog must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. Because the frog is 2 sizes smaller than the commoner, on a failed save, it would take 3d10 damage (the original 1d10 damage, which is increased by 2d10), probably exploding on impact, whilst the commoner would continue its destructive flight unhindered—questioning the laws of physics.</text>

		<text>You touch a point and infuse an area around it with osteomancy. The area can have a radius of up to 120 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect of a boneyard or hallow spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects.</text>
		<text>First, you know the exact location and hear the thoughts (if any) of any undead creature within the area, and you know if they are under someone’s control.</text>
		<text>Second, all creatures within the area lose resistance and immunity to necrotic and piercing damage.</text>
		<text>Finally, as a reaction whenever a non-undead creature dies within the area, you can choose to rip its skeleton from its flesh and force it to rise again under your control. If you do, the creature is resurrected with 1 hit point, its creature type becomes undead, it becomes immune to all damage, it loses access to any legendary actions it had (if any), and you can mentally command its actions. At the end of its next turn, it dies and cannot be resurrected by any means short of a wish spell.</text>

		<text>You call upon the power of the Great Ones, seeking their guidance. Until the spell ends, you gain the ability to cast any spell from the warlock spell list of 5th level or lower without expending a spell slot or needing to prepare the spell. As part of casting this spell, you can cast a spell with a casting time of an action from your newfound spell list. However, the cost of using this power is steep. At the end of each of your turns, you must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 2d10 psychic damage. If you fail this saving throw two times, the spell ends early and you gain a short-term madness.</text>

		<text>You dramatically increase the pull of gravity in a 30-foot-radius, 300-foot-high cylinder centered on a point on the ground within range. Creatures in this area are knocked prone and cannot lose this condition while there. A creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is knocked prone and takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. A flying creature in the area immediately falls to the ground and is knocked prone. A creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw to move or perform any action. Each foot of movement while in the area costs a creature 3 extra feet.</text>
		<text>	A prone creature that ends its turn in the cylinder must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced into the ground as gravity pulls it down. It is restrained and incapacitated by the crushing pressure and the ground around it, but it gains the benefits of three-quarters cover, as only the upper part of their body is visible. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, freeing itself from the ground on a success.</text>
		<text>	If the spell lasts for its full duration, the ground cracks under the tremendous weight generated and becomes difficult terrain. Each 5-foot-square area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand to remove the difficult terrain.</text>

The direct contact with the eldritch being causes the target to take 8d6 psychic damage, and it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is pulled in through the tear to the cosmos. On a success, it isn't pulled but gains a long-term madness, and the spell ends.</text>

It is partially absorbed by the cosmos for 1 hour, gaining a +10 bonus to Stealth checks and becoming unable to be tracked except by magical means. In addition, as an action, the creature can become incorporeal and move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain until the end of its turn. If it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 (1d10) force damage and is immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space. Once the creature uses this action, it can’t do so again for the duration of the transformation.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Starting at 14th level, when the creature uses an action to become incorporeal, the effect lasts for 10 minutes instead.</text>

A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On each of your turns after you summon the swarm, you can use a bonus action to move it up to 30 feet in any direction. This effect ends early if you take fire or radiant damage.</text>

The tenebris's wings grow longer, its flying speed increases by 20 feet, and it gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls for 1 minute or until it falls unconscious. It can gain this bonus multiple times, each time it devours a creature's shadow. A creature whose shadow has been devoured can't be targeted by this reaction again. A remove curse spell cast on a creature that lost its shadow allows it to regrow it.</text>

			<text>The aranea can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided the creature has one. The devouring requires the aranea to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice (d10s) equal to half the creature's Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the aranea's current hit points and hit point maximum by the total. For every four Hit Dice the aranea gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage on a hit. The aranea retains these benefits for 7 days.

			<name>Higher Purpose (Costs 3 Actions)</name>
			<text>Malach reaches for a higher purpose. This effect changes based on his Angel of Flesh trait.</text>
			<text>	If above 81 hit points, Malach releases an all-powerful miasma with a 20-foot radius centered on a point 120 feet of him. Each non-construct creature in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed until the end of Malach's next turn. While paralyzed in this way, a creature automatically fails its saving throws against Malach's Deadly Miasma.</text>
			<text>	If at or below 81 hit points, Malach uses his golden form to release a glimmer of sickening light. Each non-construct creature within 120 feet of Malach must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (4d8) radiant damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. This ignores immunity to the poisoned condition. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
